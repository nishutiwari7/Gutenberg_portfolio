# My Portfolio Blocks

Gutenberg plugin that provides a set of reusable blocks for portfolio websites: Hero section, Testimonial carousel, Pricing table (ACF-driven), Team grid and FAQ accordion.

Installation

1. Copy the `my-portfolio-blocks` folder into your WordPress `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Run `npm install` in the plugin folder and `npm run build` to compile assets (requires Node.js).
3. Activate the plugin in the WordPress admin.

Notes

- The Pricing Table block expects ACF PRO to provide complex fields server-side.
- This repository is a scaffold produced to demonstrate how to implement modern Gutenberg blocks.
